Hadoop Production Issues

1. DataNode Failures

Description: DataNodes may fail due to hardware or network issues, leading to data loss or unavailability.

Possible Causes:

Disk failures

Network issues

JVM crashes


Solutions:

Check disk health and ensure sufficient storage.

Investigate network connectivity.

Configure DataNode log monitoring and set up alerting.

Enable DataNode automatic restart in Hadoop configuration (dfs.datanode.restart.retries).



2. NameNode Overload

Description: NameNode becomes overloaded due to excessive metadata handling or client requests, causing delays or failures in accessing HDFS.

Possible Causes:

Large number of small files

Memory pressure

Too many client requests


Solutions:

Use HDFS Federation to distribute metadata load.

Tune NameNode heap size and garbage collection settings.

Consolidate small files using sequence files or HAR (Hadoop Archive).

Use Secondary NameNode or Checkpoints effectively.



3. Cluster Resource Contention

Description: Resource contention can lead to job failures or significant delays.

Possible Causes:

Multiple resource-intensive jobs running simultaneously.

Insufficient CPU or memory allocation.


Solutions:

Use CapacityScheduler or FairScheduler for resource allocation.

Tune job settings to limit resource usage (mapreduce.memory.mb, yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb).

Monitor cluster resource usage via Ambari or Cloudera Manager.
